As of the current version:
When you click/tap polygon moves towards that position
If you click the screen when the how to play is there, it goes away as intended
You fall as intended
Ya boi needs to be fixed up a lil
Music plays with no problems (All rights to Bungie and their team behind Destiny 2)
(Platforms cannot be stood upon)

Used to work
at one point
Attempted to add more platforms while removing past ones
thats what broke it
