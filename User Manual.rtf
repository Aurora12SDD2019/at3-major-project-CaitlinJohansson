How 14 currently works:
(Click also = tap)
Click to move ya boi polygon
Attempt to land on the platforms to survive
Going off the screen = death / game over
Current scoring system revolves around how many times you've clicked
Music plays in the background to entertain you besides the clicking around
Moving mouse around the screen makes it actually play out
